# K-Means Clustering Project

## 📌 Overview

This project demonstrates the implementation of **K-Means Clustering**, an unsupervised machine learning algorithm, using Python. The notebook walks through the process of understanding the data, applying K-Means, visualizing clusters, and evaluating the results.

## 🔍 Objective

To cluster the given dataset into distinct groups based on feature similarity using the K-Means algorithm.

## 🧰 Tools and Libraries Used

- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Scikit-learn

## 📊 Dataset

The dataset used in this project contains numerical values representing features that are used to form clusters. These features could include customer behavior, demographics, or any form of measurable data.

> **Note:** If using your own dataset, make sure it's cleaned and contains only numeric values for clustering.

## 🧠 Project Workflow

1. **Import Libraries**  
   Load required Python libraries for data analysis and visualization.

2. **Load Dataset**  
   Read the dataset using Pandas.

3. **Data Preprocessing**  
   - Handle missing values (if any).
   - Normalize or scale the data (optional depending on context).

4. **Determine Optimal Number of Clusters**  
   - Use the **Elbow Method** to find the best value of `k`.

5. **Apply K-Means Algorithm**  
   - Fit the model.
   - Predict cluster labels.

6. **Visualization**  
   - Scatter plots of clusters.
   - Cluster centroids.
   - Visualize using PCA if more than 2 features.

7. **Evaluation and Conclusion**  
   Interpret the clusters and provide insights.

## 📈 Output

- Visualizations of clustered data points.
- Optimal number of clusters using the Elbow Method.
- Summary of insights derived from clustering.

## 📎 How to Run

1. Install required libraries:
   ```bash
   pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
   ```

2. Launch Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```

3. Open `K_means_clustering.ipynb` and run all the cells.
